# Expublish

Automates semantic release versioning and best practices for elixir packages.

Explublish helps keeping a clean and trackable version history in a project,
while providing a consistent and easy release experience to its maintainers.
It was created with a continuous release process in mind and can be used to
fully automate the release of new package versions.

## What it does

Inspired by various release utilities that exist for different languages and ecosystems,
Expublish provides a mix task that guarantees a clean and functioning project state
before it performs the steps required to release a new package version following
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions.

Using `mix expublish` guarantees:

- a clean git working directory.
- passing tests.
- an increased version in mix.exs or version file.
- a new curated changelog entry.
- a new version git commit and tag.
- `git push` to given remote and branch.
- `mix hex.publish` to release the new package version and documentation to users.

Some of the steps can be opted out from and when not executed from CI,
it's recommended to _always_ execute a `--dry-run` before rerunning the expublish task without said option.

`mix expublish` supports various command-line options, check out the [Cheatsheet](./docs/CHEATSHEET.md) and [Reference](./docs/REFERENCE.md) pages.

## Getting started

1\. Follow the [installation](./docs/INSTALLATION.md) instructions.

2\. For every new release, create a`RELEASE.md` containing a new changelog entry:

```bash
$ echo "- changelog entry one\n- changelog entry two" > RELEASE.md
```

_Note the `RELEASE.md` is deleted after every successful release._

3\. Run `mix expublish`:

```bash
$ mix expublish.minor
```

## Installation
